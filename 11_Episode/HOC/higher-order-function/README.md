# Higher-order Component

What is a Higher-order Component (HOC)?
Think of a Higher-order Component (HOC) as a function that takes a component and returns a new component. In other words, it's a pattern used for reusing component logic. HOCs are not a part of the React API, but rather a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature.

Why use HOCs?
Reusability: HOCs allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components without repeating code.

Code Organization: HOCs help in separating concerns and keeping your components focused on specific tasks.

Functionality Injection: They enable you to inject additional props or behavior into components.

Key Points:
HOCs are functions that accept a component and return a new component.
They enable code reuse, separation of concerns, and functionality injection.
You can compose multiple HOCs to enhance a component's functionality.
Be mindful of component composition and performance when using HOCs.
I hope this explanation helps you understand Higher-order Components in React better! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions.
